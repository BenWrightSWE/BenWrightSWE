My name is Benjamin Wright
I am a Computer Science Major at the University of Georgia

I know an assortment of languages and tools including:
  * Python (Pandas, Numpy, flask)
  * Java
  * C
  * HTML, CSS
  * Javascript (Typescript, React, Next.js, Node.js)
  * Database tools (SQL, SQLite, MongoDB)
  * Unitest

I love the ability to create what you want with coding and look
  forward to the things I will be working on in the future.
